So far, I've seen the first two seasons (up to episode 104) ... and it feels like the exact opposite of DM, boring characters, uninteresting plot, way too many filler episodes ... I heard that it gets better in season 3 and I hope that it's right, because otherwise the drop in quality compared to DM would be immense (even though this is a spin-off series).\n\nFrom what I heard, 5D's should be the best season of YGO! and Zexal should suck really bad. \nIn my opinion, YGO! series can be divided into two groups: Fun-based (GX, Zexal) and plot-based (DM, 5D's). From what I've seen, I definitely enjoy the second group a lot more, so I expect to love 5D's a lot. What about Arc-V, though? Is it serious enough or is it - once again - more children-orientated?\n\nIf you have already seen at least 30 episodes of Arc-V, can you tell me how good it is compared to other YGO! series? Is it enjoyable? Are there duels that last longer than two episodes? Do you enjoy the characters?\n\nI appreciate all responses in this topic, as well as your opinions.\n\n- Steeldude",

The people on Anilist.  Just toss out any anime you thought were absolutely amazing and that I may like just as much.  It doesn't even have to be a similar genre to Death Note.

I think these shows have all __brought something special to the anime genre__, or had some __effect on the community__, and should at least deserve a try. If you have anime you think should be watched, be honest. Don't confuse the terms Must-Watch with Personal Favorite.\n\nEarly when this thread was made, a few people made a good point. They said I was confusing __Highly Acclaimed__ shows with __Popular ones__. That I can see, and I agree with them. Just because a show is Popular, doesn't necessarily make it of good quality or high acclaim. But I still think if a show was popular, it deserves some recognition, because their had to have been a reason why the show was popular, it had to bring something to the table. So to be fair, I'm renaming the thread to include both Highly Acclaimed and Popular shows. \n\nIn no particular order, here are the anime I think you should give a try at some point:\n\n\n__Fate/Zero \nPuella Magi Madoka Magica \nCowboy Bebop \nTrigun \nAttack on Titan \nFull Metal Alchemist\nNeon Genesis Evangelion\nCode Geass\nDeath Note\nNaruto (First Series)\nPokemon (Indigo League)\nMonster\n__\nWhat do you guys think? and what are your recommendations for must watch anime?",

Kamui and his crew hijacks some trains and start shooting the people on it. They are trying to overload the system so that they can get access to the mainframe. The goal is to make Sybil judge him so that they can judge Sybil. Akame figures everything out and must now confront Tougane and Kamui in a final showdown between Sybil and the people.\n\nimg500(http://i.imgur.com/pakbvv1.png)\n\n__My thoughts__\nFirst of I need to comment on the soundtrack. This is the first time I got goosebumps watching Psycho-Pass and it was pretty much all thanks to it. I like that this is wrapping up nicely and I can see a very exiting final episode coming up. Not sure I like the appearance of Kougamis spirit, but I do like it when Akame handles on her own and is not just a bystander. Looking forward to next week!\n\n__Random quote__\n\"The law doesn't protect people.

Is there actually a sense of community to do so? Okay, I'm getting off topic)~~\n\nIt would be interesting to see the results.  Well to be put it simply, this is the only question I think is relevant to ask:\n\n- What's your favorite anime?\n\n\n[Link to form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/104lJGAr0kOjBn0J_Jtn5R_J8PZcjy-BUFavdMXAwePA/viewform?usp=send_form) \n\nJust for the sake of clarity, I'm putting the description I wrote on the form here as well:\n\n_\"RULES\nONLY PUT ONE ANIME IN THE TEXT BOX. After that you can click on \"Submit another response\" to add more. Remember, one at a time. This is for data purposes. Please. \n\nTHE ANIME TITLE MUST BE IN JAPANESE ROMAJI. You can find this on the anilist anime page under anime data. This is because some anime don't have an English alias, so please use \"Shingeki no Kyojin\" instead of \"Attack on Titan\". Also, NO ABBREVIATIONS, so no \"AoT, SnK\". If everyone would use different names, we'd have too many people voting the same but not grouped together because they didn't use the same name.\n\nADD AS MANY AS YOU LIKE. This is not really a rule, but yeah, in case you were wondering...\"\n_\nThis is to make sure the same anime won't be counted as two, or that several anime won't be counted as one. \n\n\n[Link to form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/104lJGAr0kOjBn0J_Jtn5R_J8PZcjy-BUFavdMXAwePA/viewform?usp=send_form) \n\n[For anyone who just wants to see the results\n](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/104lJGAr0kOjBn0J_Jtn5R_J8PZcjy-BUFavdMXAwePA/viewanalytics)\nI went ahead and added mine already! :)",

Her behavior towards him also express that she doesn't trust him completely.\nAt school they get an hint that Kuzuki-sensei (who wasn't suspicious at all) may be the master of Caster. So they decide to set up a trap on his way to the temple.\n\nimg320(http://i.imgur.com/PozaaUR.png)\n_Here we can see crazy kids lurking around and shooting magic at random people_\n\nBut it tourned out that Kuzukis physikal abilities are on a complete different level as they expected. Rin goes down after one hit, Saber gets cought by his strength on suprise and only Shirou can deal any damage to Kuzuki with his magic. \n\nAt the end we see Gilgamesh with his new master in the underground basement form Fate/Zero where Sakura enjoyed her bath with the insects.\n\n__Opinion__\nThe fact that Kazuki is a master isn't quite a suprise because he really looked suspicious in every scene but didn't expect him to be casters after all the \"I made him my puppet\"-stuff she told.\nI liked fights because this time because we got a good look at Shirous and Kuzukis abilitiys and how to wipe the floor with Saber :D\n\n__WEBm__\n\nShirou and his fancy magic\nwebm(http://a.pomf.se/bcyzkq.webm)\n\nKuzuki and his magic hands ;)\nwebm(http://a.pomf.se/lvmvex.webm)\n\n\n@Pluuu I hope u don't mind if I copy ur layout :o",

To be blunt, it would be great if we could receive a notification when someone comments-on-comment we've made on someone's profile. Currently, we receive a notification if someone comments on our profile or if they comment-on-comment on our profile. In other words, comment notifications are limited to our profile alone. I would like to see this expand to other profiles as well, since it could come handy at realizing that someone has shared further input on a comment you've made.\n\nWhile obtaining a notification when someone comments-on-comment with your comment being the main/original one is the thread's certain suggestion, there is one more we could talk about. What if you are not the poster of the main comment, but only comment-on-comment, with someone else then continuing the discussion be posting a comment-on-comment as well? We could see this as a new comment being posted in a discussion you've participated and you could obtain a notification here as well, but this is more expanded. The first suggestion is the main one that would certainly be good to have.\n\nSo, to summarize the main idea: Please make it so we receive a notification if someone comments-on-comment we've made on someone's profile.\n\nThank you.",

        "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nIt goes without saying that a large portion of us do appreciate Clannad and its infamous After Story. Some of you may remember me raving about it last week, and I can honestly say after days of tears and recreating a significant portion of the OST on the keyboard...it has given me quite a bit of inspiration.\n\nAs a studied musician, it is my second nature to make any great show great on any medium...and I feel the strong emotional content of this show and relatively affordable method of staging could turn it into a musical. I'm sure I'm not the first person that has thought of this, but I am almost certain I could find a means to doing it.\n\nThat being the case - I'm sure I will get some trolling or degrading comments, but I have to ask the following questions humbly:\n\n1. __Is this a good idea?__ I'm by no means a well-known composer nor am I everyone's favorite, and am writing in certainty that it may not go further than a small stage somewhere wherever I am able to complete it. Regardless, I do write with passion, love doing it, and think that Clannad deserves more attention than just us anime lovers. I just am curious if a community like Anilist would be interesting in hearing it if by some miracle it could happen?\n\n2. Musicals are usually misunderstood as an American routine, which in the case of the story of an anime about Japanese high schoolers growing up in Japan and living Japanese lifestyles I'm working against a lot of cultural differences. I am familiar with Japanese stage performance, but the musical style is too foreign and traditional to draw in a random audience. I would just then say I'd write it in operatic style, but that also is preconceived as sounding Italian and will turn off a rather important group of listeners. Any ideas?\n\n3. English or Japanese? I am fine with either, but many performers from either Japan or an English-speaking country aren't.\n\n4. An effective performance cannot be longer than 3 hours - especially with a topic as complicated as this one. Clannad's biggest strength is the emotional buildup through two full seasons - roughly 21 captivating hours at the viewer's discretion. What key relationships would you want to see happen if you could only get 3 hours worth? Is the Illusionary World critical enough to be included?\n\n5. Legal issues? Usually in music authorizing any sales and royalties or performance costs are negotiated by the original creators. However, as I am unaware of Japanese copyright laws, I would be developing an original creation under different copyright than its original creation. I fear being told to destroy the material for infringement and not having a leg to stand on. Thoughts?\n\nThanks everyone. :-)",

About 10 volumes at most would be best, regardless of chapter count.\n- Scanlation isn't complete shit. I can't count how many manga that weren't actually bad I had to drop because the scanlations were so awful.\n- Preferably not shoujo romance. Other genres of shoujo are possibly okay.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Bonus points if their title start with A-F since it might be something I've overlooked on my backlogs.",

I'm still hoping he still has a chance to not be forgotten, but it probably isn't gonna happen.\n\nWith the future where Shirazaki dies, I'm getting the feeling it happens _because_ he chose to become a Shepard, and that's why he can't change it. Just a thought.\n\nAnyway, what are your thoughts on it?",
